Sentiment Analysis Metrics and Evaluation
	- Performance Metric: Cross Validation
Precision, Recall and Accuracy
	- Precision measures how many texts were predicted correctly as belonging to a given category out of all of the texts that were predicted (correctly and incorrectly) as belonging to the category.
	- Recall measures how many texts were predicted correctly as belonging to a given category out of all the texts that should have been predicted as belonging to the category. We also know that the more data we feed our classifiers with, the better recall will be.
	- Accuracy measures how many texts were predicted correctly (both as belonging to a category and not belonging to the category) out of all of the texts in the corpus.

	- Comparisons: 
	- Emojis: 
Defining Neutral: Challenging when it comes to defining  Objective texts, Irrelevant Information or Text Containing Wishes
